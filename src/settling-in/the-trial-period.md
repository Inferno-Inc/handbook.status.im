# ü¶æ The trial period

We consider your first 12 weeks of contributing as a trial period. During this time, you'll work alongside and be treated like other Status contributors - you'll have access to the same information, software, (virtual) meetups, and learning opportunities. We're confident that you will be a great addition, or we wouldn't have extended an offer!

However, we have seen that sometimes things don't work out. Working remotely, on new tech, with a super flexible team that's constantly iterating and evolving isn't to everyone's tastes. We want to be very upfront about what we expect from everyone on the team.

A clearly defined initial tryout will allow enough time to get to know each other and fully appreciate how we can work together. It might also be that you decide that Status isn't what you're looking for, and that's okay too.


## What we expect

* We expect you to show us you can prioritize correctly, get things done, and find answers in an increasingly autonomous way. In most teams, there will be a first project scoped out for you. Regardless of that being the case, make sure you ask your lead where you can start, clarify expectations for your role, or seek feedback on how you're doing, early and regularly.
* We expect you to be accountable for your goals and deadlines. We don't micromanage - if by any chance you realize you're stuck, make sure to flag it and discuss within your team whether or not it would be best to change course.
* We don't see each other much, and written communication is what we see the most from each other. We'd like for everyone to be clear, friendly, and helpful to everyone else. Great communication is key! 
* We expect a consistent and high volume of communication to keep your fellow contributors updated on your progress. There's no expectation that you reply to each ping immediately. Do your work and avoid interruptions while checking your messages at least a couple of times a day. If you know you won't have time to look into something right away, let the other party know when they can expect to have an answer to organise their work efficiently.
* Everyone should contribute to the products and our culture. If you see anything that can be improved and have an idea to make it better, bring it up! If you see that a co-contributor is stuck, offer to help or ping someone who can. We're all in the same boat trying to achieve the same goals so let's help each other! 
* Read [this article](https://medium.com/remote-work/12-qualities-to-look-for-when-hiring-remote-workers-68243ff351b0). It gives a sense of what qualities are most important to succeed in any role here at Status.
* For those less experienced in the blockchain/crypto space - jump in and immerse yourself in the ecosystem and get to understand our principles and mission better. This is a big topic, and we don't expect everyone to become an expert. Still, we would be super impressed to see that you're committed to continuously learning and developing your knowledge.
* Try to model our principles in all that you do at Status.
* In order to help with what behaviours create value, here you can see a Status-specific list of [value-creating behaviors]() and some examples in which they could manifest.

## Performance platform

One of the ways People Ops can support reaching our broader organizational goals is by providing frameworks and support to make sure performance conversations take place. And that they‚Äôre useful in identifying where each contributor is shining, and where they should focus to make sure the overarching product and strategy goals are met.

Our aim is to normalize (self-)evaluations and talking about what‚Äôs good and what is less good on a continous basis. Lattice is our performance management platform across Status. It is widely used for mid & end of trial, mid & end of year, as well as ongoing feedback.

## Mid-trial feedback

Within your first few weeks, you will automatically be invited to join the Lattice platform to set up your user profile. Once you hit 40 days of contributing to Status, you will be prompted to select 3-6 peers for your feedback circle and complete your own self-assessment of your contributions. Think carefully about who you would like to include, it should be people who are familiar with your work and the contributions you have made so far. 

üí° Top Tip - If you are in a services team, include CC‚Äôs within the programs or projects you support. 

This feedback circle will be approved by your project lead who is also a reviewer by default.

Feedback will be collected automatically and aggregated into a report for you to discuss with your project lead during your next 1-1. 


## End-trial feedback

After 85 days, you will need to repeat the process of selecting your feedback circle and complete your self-assessment. Your feedback scores and comments will be aggregated and your project lead will share the feedback results within 1-2 weeks. At that time, your project lead will make and communicate a decision on whether your trial has been successful.

Once you have passed your trial period, we expect feedback to be regularly shared through the Lattice platform on an ongoing basis.

We hope for all our trials to be successful. Still, we may not see the potential for a productive future collaboration together. In that case, People Ops or your project lead will reach out to you about extending your trial or terminating your service agreement with Status and any related logistics.


## ‚ùì FAQs

   * **Who has access to the trial feedback?**

     The People Ops team, your project lead, Carl, Jarrad.

   * **Who decides on the trial outcome?**

     The contributor's project lead, who is responsible for the contracting/staffing decisions on their project.          People Ops acts as a facilitator in the process.

   * **Is the feedback anonymous??**

     Feedback from peers is anonymous and the scores and comments are aggregated. 
     Feedback from project leads is not anonymous. .

   * **How do you evaluate whether a trial is successful?**

     Based on the feedback received via the trial process. We ask a diverse set of questions in the feedback form to      get a mix of data points - numerical, qualitative, and comparative. We aggregate all responses received. Work        output not showing advancement of the Principles, nor important qualities like productivity, autonomy, or            visibility, would be indicators of a poor role fit. Contribution not being impactful overall to Status's              objectives or developmental feedback not being addressed would also be reasons to end the trial.

   * **Why do you ask so many contributors for feedback?**

     The feedback circle is between 3-6 peers plus a team lead. The response rate is typically ~60%. We want to get        as many voices and opinions involved to make the process as fair as possible.

   * **How will I know what happens with someone's trial?**

     We want to be sensitive to each person's privacy by not discussing details about their performance with other        contributors. As such, we don't (at this point) announce whether trials were successful or not, but we're open        to changing that if people would prefer this was made transparent. We'd likely not be able to give specific          details of a trial outcome, though.

   * **Can I give trial feedback even if I wasn't directly asked?**

     100%! You can share trial feedback anytime. You can jump into Lattice and give anyone feedback at any time! 

   * **This process seems pretty centralized; what's up with that?**

     You're not wrong! The trial feedback process was an interim solution to make contracting/staffing as high            quality and consistent across Status, but it has stuck in the absence of better alternatives being identified.        It's far from perfect, and we're always looking to adapt and iterate it, so [share your ideas]                (https://discuss.status.im/t/trial-periods-what-next/795) with People Ops, and we'll incorporate them!
     
   * **How do I get feedback after the trial period?**

     We encourage a continuous feedback culture where you give and receive ongoing feedback. These happen recurrently      through our internal feedback platform, during your chats with other contributors, and whenever there's feedback      to be shared, such as at the end of a project or after a relevant event. Lattice provides the platform to give        feedback to anyone at any time as well as more scheduled times such as mid and end-of-year performance reviews.
