# üßæ Third-party invoices format

As part of contributing to Status, you might need to submit invoices or engage with service subscriptions or external vendors and contractors. This page has information about what we'll need to provide fully compliant invoices.

Here's a sample of how invoices should look, as well as all the appropriate data points needed. If any data is missing from the invoice, we won't be able to pay it and will ask you to arrange a revision with the vendor.
