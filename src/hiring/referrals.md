# üëë Your most important role

There are many ways you can help Status grow: engaging with the community, interviewing, helping out with events, etc., but referring outstanding people is one of the most direct ways you can make an impact.

As an organization, we're reliant on many groups to help us reach our goals: freelancers, community members, testers, researchers, users and more. We need these groups who make hugely valuable contributions, alongside Core Contributors who work with Status on a full-time basis.

Hiring Core Contributors that align with our values and excel in their field is essential to us; and we'd love your help! Below, you'll find helpful information to connect the extraordinary people you know with Status.


## Referral bonus

If you've worked with someone amazing and think they would be a great fit at Status, not only would we like to know, but we'll also reward you once they've successfully completed their trial period.

We will reward you an SNT referral bonus of USD 5,000 after the candidate has been with Status as a core contributor for three months. At times, we might offer higher rewards for specific critical roles, so stay tuned for updates in the Town Halls and #people-ops channel!

### Eligibility criteria

  * You can only refer candidates that have not applied to us independently within the last 90 days.
  * Referrals are for individuals; we are not responsible for any fees related to resumes received from recruitment agencies.
  * The initial contact between us and your referral must be facilitated by you. If someone is already known to us or is in the middle of the hiring process, we wouldn't consider it a new referral.
  * The referral bonus only applies to hiring core contributors that join us on a full-time or long-term basis. It does not apply to hiring part-time or short-term contractors.
  * For someone you refer, you would be removed from any interview process involving them (this ensures we are fair and unbiased in our recruitment process).
  * Unfortunately, if you are the team lead, the referral bonus doesn‚Äôt apply if you have hired someone into the role you are leading.

Sorry for the many conditions! We want to be fair and apply some common-sense guidelines, but let us know if you have any better ideas! :)

## How to make a referral

Here are the basics of referring incredible people to join Status. There are a few ways:

  * Using Greenhouse ATS (Applicant Tracking System) to refer someone you know, and make sure to add their contact information, CV, and where and why you think they'd be great for Status. The team reads the notes when reviewing referrals, so this can help them stand out among other qualified candidates.
    * Ask the Talent team to give you access if the link isn't working for you.
    * While you should share people whose work you can speak to and are impressed by (i.e., the top 25% of people you've worked with), don't feel pressured to refer everyone who asks. If you feel uncomfortable saying no (we get it; it can be awkward), you can mention it in the notes in the referral form.
  * Send the CV along with a note detailing why you recommend them, how well you know this person etc to [referrals@status.im](mailto:referrals@status.im) (Talent will upload to Greenhouse adding you as referrer; alongside the notes you provide)

  * The recruiting team will take good care of them and keep you posted on their progress through the hiring process. Still, you can be a critical layer of support to them by:
    * Helping them prep for interviews or activities, just enough for them to be prepared. 
      * But not too much, we‚Äôve had instances in the past where referrals were prepped too well, meaning they did great during the interview process but then struggled once the were onboarded.
  * Answering questions about working at Status and your experiences.
  * If they get an offer, help us convince them to accept it!


> ‚ú® Diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences lead to better products. When you refer talent from underrepresented groups, particularly into technical positions, you're doing your part to build a diverse workforce across all functions and levels.

## It doesn't always work out

While referrals generally have a much higher success rate than regular applications, there may be a chance that your referral doesn't end up joining Status *(the performance of the contributor won‚Äôt be held against you, after all it‚Äôs on the team to interview and come to a decision on whether they deem the candidate a fit for the role/team).* This might happen due to:

  * Timing: their qualifications don't match the roles currently available.
  * Suitability: they don't meet all of the minimum requirements listed for the role.
  * Competition: there was someone else who was more qualified.
  * Demand: the role was reduced or closed.
  * Referrals who eventually join the project are typically considered for multiple roles over a period of time before we extend them an offer.
